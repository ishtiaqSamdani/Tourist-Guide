                            Kedarnath temple is not only famous among the tourists who are religiously inclined, but it
                            is tremendously famous among other nature lovers as well because of its location. The temple
                            is located amid the majestic Himalayan glaciers, and during the winter, the entire area gets
                            covered in snow. That is why it remains closed for half the year. This temple is built for
                            Lord Shiva and is claimed to be built by the Pandavas from the Mahabharata. Pilgrims have to
                            walk over a distance of more than 14 km to reach there.
                            <h5>How to reach: Tourists reach Kedarnath by trekking from Gaurikund, which can be reached
                                by traveling through a bus from Rishikesh. Reaching Rishikesh is not that tough since it
                                is connected to several cities of India via trains.</h5>
