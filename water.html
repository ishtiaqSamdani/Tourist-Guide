                            with great degree of flora and fauna, courtesy the hill forests of Cauvery Wildlife
                            Sanctuary. For photography enthusiasts this is the place to be. After all, a selfie with the

                            waterfalls in India with an altitude of 1017 feet. The falls are a sight to behold
                            especially if you go there in the monsoons, when the fall is in full flow. Water falling
                            down from a height forms clouds of milky foam at the bottom, creating a visual of aesthetic
                            beauty. Set amidst the crescent shaped valley carpeted with lush green flora, the falls are
                            a perfect getaway for your honeymoon.

                            photographers. The fog clinging at the bottom of the furious flowing falls makes for a scene
                            you must bring back with you.

                            the place. Based in Bundi, Bhimlat exhilarates the best of its charm during monsoons. The 60
                            meters high waterfall makes for a great scenic relief in the horrid summers of Rajasthan. If
