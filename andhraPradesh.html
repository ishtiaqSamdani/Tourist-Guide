                    <p>
                        Papikondalu mountain range runs along the River Godavari (Western Godavari) and is located in
                        Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh. Papikondalu is a sheer fest to the eyes in terms of its scenic
                        beauty. As the hills become closer and closer to the visitor, the
                        width of the mighty Godavari becomes narrower. In accordance with this view resembling the
                        middle partition of a woman's hair, it was initially named as 'Papidi' Kondalu- Paidi in Telugu
                        means the middle partition of a woman’s
                        hair. Later, it came to be known as Papikondalu in the local language. The river narrowing, its
                        twists and turns along with the Papi Hills form a breathtaking visual experience.
